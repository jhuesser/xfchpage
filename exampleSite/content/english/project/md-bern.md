## Ingress Mission Day Bern

$Mission Day brings together Agents from both factions to explore cities around the world through the lens of Ingress with unique and local adventures on foot.

Agents, we want to discover Bern on Saturday December 15th, 2018. In collaboration with the [City of Bern](https://www.bern.com/en) we will provide you high quality missions to explore the city on foot together.

**You need to complete at least 12 Missions for the Badge. Checkout the** [**Missions!**](https://bern.missionday.ch/index.html#mission-badges)
